# ARTDECO
### My first website. I used basic of HTML, CSS (SCSS), and simple JS. The website looks good both on small devices such as phones and on large screens - tablets and computers.
### The website has simple and basic animations. JS is mainly responsible for changing the colors of various elements. I also added a simple modal - you can find it when you click on 'Private Policy' at the bottom of the page.
